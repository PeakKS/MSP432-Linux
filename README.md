# MSP432-Linux
Example repo for building, flashing, and debugging the MSP432 LaunchPad board on Linux

## Usage
### Building
Edit the list of your source files in the Makefile and run `make`.

### Flashing
Just run `make flash` and OpenOCD will flash the board with the hex file.

### Debugging
Run `make debugserver` to start the OpenOCD debug server for GDB to connect to. You can run `make debug` to connect to the server easily. Alternatively, start GDB targeting the firmware ELF file and run the command `target extended-remote localhost:3333` to connect.
